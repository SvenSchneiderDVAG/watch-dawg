# Watch Dawg

Watch Dawg is a tool written in Go to observe download folder and sorting known files to dedicated folders.

For e.g. files with extension '.txt' or '.pdf' automatically will be moved to folder 'Documents'.

Please note: This tool is a work in progress and helps me learning to code in go.
